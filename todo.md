## Frontend

## Backend Java

- Threadpooling
- Re-Factoring code (the controller code should be reduced, blocks
of code accessing the DB or validating parameters should be put in 
different files under a utility or service directory)
- Re-Factoring code 2 (The input of GET and POST request could be 
checked by creating Java classes for each input)
